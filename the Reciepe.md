first you put the piece of raw steak on the cutting board and hit it with the meat mallet a few times, this is to make it tender so you can chew through it, but don't hit it too much or else your gonna end up with some steak soup. After you tenderized it put some salt and pepper on it, make sure you put it on both the top and the bottom of the steak by flipping it over, this is so when the steak is cooked, the flavors of salt and pepper will sink in nicely with the steak. Next put the steak on the grill and cook it. Make sure to flip it over after 5-10 minutes, if its brown then you cooked it for long enough, if its still pink or pinkish, flip it back over for that side to cook for another 5-10 minutes. Once both sides are cooked put the steak back on the cutting board and take out the peeled lemon. Hold the lemon above the steak and squeeze the juices out of it so the lemon juices land on the steak. After that put the steak on the plate and your done!
